## Overview

Our project aims to develop a method to identify potential mediator variables that are not present in the original dataset. A mediator is a variable that helps explain the relationship between a treatment variable and an outcome variable, and explains the causal relationships in greater detail.
We systematically search for mediator variables using external datasets and conditional correlation analysis. This method provides a way to uncover hidden factors that are influenced by regions and influence happiness levels, offering better understanding of what shapes well-being across different regions.
Our approach also uses LLM's in order to reduce options for mediator variables by using the existing domain knowledge embedded within the LLMs. This way, we utilize LLMs in order to check smaller amount of potential mediator variables, means less calculation and less computing time.
